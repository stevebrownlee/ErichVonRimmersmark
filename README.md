# Erich Von Rimmersmark Exercise

Ref: [Dependency Inversion Chapter](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-inc/blob/cohort-30/book-1-orientation/chapters/DEPENDENCY_INVERSION.md)

This exercise asks students uncouple an initially tightly coupled object method. They need to author interfaces for certain monsters that are susceptible to certain kinds of weapons. Then use those interfaces in a higher level module so that multiple monsters can be killed by each weapon type.

This implementation also uses generics at the request of @kimberly-bird, my junior instructor. It's only feasible code if a student successfully attempts the puzzle challenge in the chapter.
